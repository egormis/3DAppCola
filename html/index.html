          <h3>History of Coca Cola:</h3>
          <p>
            1886-1892 Atlanta Beginnings: It was 1886, and in New York Harbour,
            workers were constructing the Statue of Liberty. Eight hundred miles
            away, another great American symbol was about to be unveiled. Like
            many people who change history, John Pemberton, an Atlanta
            pharmacist, was inspired by simple curiosity. One afternoon, he
            stirred up a fragrant, caramel-coloured liquid and, when it was
            done, he carried it a few doors down to Jacobs' Pharmacy. Here, the
            mixture was combined with carbonated water and sampled by customers
            who all agreed - this new drink was something special. So Jacobs'
            Pharmacy put it on sale for five cents (about 3p) a glass.

          <h3>Fanta</h3>
          <p>
            First introduced in 1940, Fanta is a vibrant, fruity soft drink that
            has become one of the most popular beverages globally. Originally
            created in Germany, Fanta now offers a wide variety of flavors and
            is enjoyed in over 180 countries. Known for its bold, refreshing
            taste, Fanta comes in different fruit flavors, with orange being the
            most iconic. Fanta Zero, part of our no-sugar range, delivers the
            same delicious fruity taste without the sugar or calories, making it
            a popular choice for those seeking a healthier option.

          <h3>Dr Pepper</h3>
          <p>
            Dr Pepper's unique, sparkling blend of 23 fruit flavours has been
            around for well over a century and it's still the same, with that
            distinctive flavour you just can't quite put your tongue on. It was
            created by Texas pharmacist Charles Alderton in 1885. He gave a
            sample of the first ever batch to Wade Morrison, a local shop owner,
            and Mr Morrison instantly agreed to stock the drink. The
            distinctive, bold taste of Dr Pepper has been popular ever since.
